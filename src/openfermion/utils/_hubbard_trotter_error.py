def simulation_ordered_grouped_hubbard_terms_with_info(

    """Give terms from the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian in simulated order.

    Uses the simulation ordering, grouping terms into hopping
    (i^ j + j^ i) and on-site potential (i^j^ i j) operators.
    Pre-computes term information (indices each operator acts on, as
    well as whether each operator is a hopping operator).

    Args:
        hubbard_hamiltonian (FermionOperator): The Hamiltonian.
        original_ordering (list): The initial Jordan-Wigner canonical order.

    Returns:
        A 3-tuple of terms from the Hubbard Hamiltonian in order of
        simulation, the indices they act on, and whether they are hopping
        operators (both also in the same order).

    Notes:
        Assumes that the Hubbard model has spin and is on a 2D square
        aperiodic lattice. Uses the "stagger"-based Trotter step for the
        Hubbard model detailed in Kivlichan et al., "Quantum Simulation
        of Electronic Structure with Linear Depth and Connectivity",
        arxiv:1711.04789.
