def generate_parity_permutations(seq):
    """
    Generates the permutations and sign of a sequence by constructing a tree
    where the nth level contains all n-permutations of m (n < m) objects.

    At the last level where n == m all permutations are generated.  The sign
    is kept updated by determining where the next number is inserted into the
    current leaf's set of numbers.

    Example:
         Constructing the permutations of the sequence [A, B, C] constructs the
         following tree:

         [[(A, +1)], [(AB, +1), (BA, -1)], [(ABC, +1), (ACB, -1), (CAB, +1],
