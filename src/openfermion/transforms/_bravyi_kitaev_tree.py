    Implementation from arxiv:1701.07072

    Note that this implementation is different from the one described in
    arXiv:quant-ph/0003137. In particular, it gives different results
    when the total number of modes is not a power of 2. The one described
    in arXiv:quant-ph/0003137 is the same as the one described in
    arXiv:1208.5986, and it is implemented in OpenFermion under the name
    `bravyi_kitaev`.
