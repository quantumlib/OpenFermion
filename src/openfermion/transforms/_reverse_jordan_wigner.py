    Operators are mapped as follows:

    Y_j -> i (a^\dagger_j - a_j) Z_{j-1} Z_{j-2} .. Z_0

    Args:
        qubit_operator: the QubitOperator to be transformed.
        n_qubits: the number of qubits term acts on. If not set, defaults
                to the maximum qubit number acted on by term.

    Returns:
