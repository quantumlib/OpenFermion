# Summary: Dependabot config file for OpenFermion.
#
# By default, Dependabot labels all pull requests with label 'dependencies'.
# We use `dependency bug`, so have to configure Dependabot appropriately.

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    # The "docker" ecosystem directive makes Dependabot look for a Dockerfile
    # in the specified directory.

      - "/docker/"
      - "/dev_tools/requirements/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "dependency bug"
      - "docker"

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    # The "github-actions" code explicitly looks in /.github/workflows if the
    # value "/" is given for the directory attribute. Yes, that's confusing.
