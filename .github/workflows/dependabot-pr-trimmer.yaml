# Trim parts of the Dependabot PR text that are unnecessary in the git history.
#
# The trimming needs to be performed before the PR is merged so that the commit
# message is based on the trimmed version. This prevents us from using events
# such as the PR getting closed or merged. Triggering on merge queue events is
# also problematic, because a merge_queue event doesn't have the equivalent of
# "pull_request.user" and we need that to test if the PR came from Dependabot.
# So instead, this workflow triggers when auto-merge is enabled for the PR.
