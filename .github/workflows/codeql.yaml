# Zero-configuration modular workflow to run CodeQL code scans.
#
# CodeQL is a semantic code analysis tool that finds vulnerabilities by
# understanding the code's logic. It is provided by GitHub. CodeQL's findings
# are reported in the repo's code-scanning results page,
# https://github.com/quantumlib/REPO/security/code-scanning/.
