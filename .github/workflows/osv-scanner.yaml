# Summary: run Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) code scan.
#
# The OSV project provides a GA workflow that you can reference as a step with
# "uses: google/osv-scanner-action/.github/workflows/osv-scanner-reusable.yml".
# Unfortunately, that workflow inexplicably doesn't use the latest version of
# the scanner and reporter workflows, and also does other things like hard-code
# the value of the osv-scanner "--gh-annotations" option to "false". Using the
# separate actions directly allows us to adjust the options and use Dependabot
# to update the workflow versions as new ones are introduced.
#
# For more examples and options, including how to ignore specific
# vulnerabilities, see https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/github-action/.
