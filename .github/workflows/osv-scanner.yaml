# Zero-config modular workflow to run Open Source Vulnerabilities code scans.
#
# The OSV scanner is a dependency vulnerability scanner that identifies known
# vulnerabilities in a project's dependencies. It supports C/C++, Python, Java,
# JavaScript, and others. The findings are reported in the repo's code-scanning
# results page, https://github.com/quantumlib/REPO/security/code-scanning/.
#
# Note: the OSV project provides a workflow you can reference as a step with
# uses: google/osv-scanner-action/.github/workflows/osv-scanner-reusable-pr.yml.
# Unfortunately, that workflow hardcodes some behaviors (such as uploading the
# SARIF file to the workflow Actions tab, which we have never needed). The
# workflow in this file is basically a heavily modified version of theirs.
#
# For more OSV scanner examples and options, including how to ignore specific
# vulnerabilities, see https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/github-action/.
