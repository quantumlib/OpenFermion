    "\n",
    "To simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, we must choose a representation of the ladder operators on the Hilbert space of the qubits. In other words, we must designate a set of qubit operators (matrices) which satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations. Qubit operators are written in terms of the Pauli matrices $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. In OpenFermion a representation is specified by a transform function which maps fermionic operators (typically instances of FermionOperator) to qubit operators (instances of QubitOperator). In this demo we will discuss the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transforms, which are implemented by the functions `jordan_wigner` and `bravyi_kitaev`.\n",

    "By comparing the action of $\\tilde{a}_p$ on $\\lvert z_0, \\ldots, z_{N-1} \\rangle$ in the JWT with the action of $a_p$ on $\\lvert n_0, \\ldots, n_{N-1} \\rangle$ (described in the first section of this demo), we can see that the JWT is associated with a particular mapping of bitstrings $e: \\{0, 1\\}^N \\to \\{0, 1\\}^N$, namely, the identity map $e(x) = x$. In other words, under the JWT, the fermionic basis vector $\\lvert n_0, \\ldots, n_{N-1} \\rangle$ is represented by the computational basis vector $\\lvert z_0, \\ldots, z_{N-1} \\rangle$, where $z_p = n_p$ for all $p$.

To see why we might be interested in these other transforms, observe that under the JWT, $\\tilde{a}_p$ acts not only on qubit $p$ but also on qubits $0, \\ldots, p-1$. This means that fermionic operators with low weight can get mapped to qubit operators with high weight, where by weight we mean the number of modes or qubits an operators acts on. There are some disadvantages to having high-weight operators; for instance, they may require more gates to simulate and are more expensive to measure on some near-term hardware platforms. In the worst case, the annihilation operator on the last mode will map to an operator which acts on all the qubits. To emphasize this point let's apply the JWT to the annihilation operator on mode 99:"

The corresponding transform will map annihilation operators to qubit operators with weight $O(\\log N)$, which is much smaller than the $\\Omega(N)$ weight associated with the JWT and parity transforms. This fact was noticed by [Bravyi and Kitaev](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003137), and later [Havlíček and others](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07072) pointed out that the encoder which achieves this is implemented by a classical data structure called a Fenwick tree. The transforms described in these two papers actually correspond to different variants of the Fenwick tree data structure and give different results when the total number of modes is not a power of 2. OpenFermion implements the one from the first paper as `bravyi_kitaev` and the one from the second paper as `bravyi_kitaev_tree`. Generally, the first one (`bravyi_kitaev`) is preferred because it results in operators with lower weight and is faster to compute.\n",
