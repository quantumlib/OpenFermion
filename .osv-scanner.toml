# OSV prior to version 2.0 is unable to parse pip version specs correctly:
# https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues/1483#issuecomment-2585999293
# The suggested workaround is to configure osv-scanner to ignore the particular
# cases it complains about. The following are all about NumPy, because
# osv-scanner can't understand the version spec "numpy>=1.24,<2.0" and
# therefore raises errors about all versions of NumPy, including very old ones.
# Ignoring these specific dependencies is okay because we will never use the
# old versions of NumPy and it doesn't block detection of future new
# vulnerabilities.
