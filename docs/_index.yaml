        <p>
        OpenFermion is an open source library for compiling and analyzing
        quantum algorithms to simulate fermionic systems, including quantum
        chemistry. Among other functionalities, this version features data
        structures and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of
        fermionic and qubit Hamiltonians. For more information, see the
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07629" class="external">release paper</a>.
