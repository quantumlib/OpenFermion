This is the electronic repulsion integral (ERI) matrix in chemist notation. We will refer to the ERI matrix as $W$. By diagonalizing $W$, one obtains $W g_\\ell = \\lambda_\\ell g_\\ell$ where the eigenvector $g_\\ell$ is a vector of dimension $N^2$.

This is a big improvement over the usual way of doing things, which would lead to no less than $O(N^5)$ depth!
