    "## Initializing the FermionOperator data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Fermionic systems are often treated in second quantization where arbitrary operators can be expressed using the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, $a^\\dagger_k$ and $a_k$.  The fermionic ladder operators play a similar role to their qubit ladder operator counterparts, $\\sigma^+_k$ and $\\sigma^-_k$ but are distinguished by the canonical fermionic anticommutation relations, $\\{a^\\dagger_i, a^\\dagger_j\\} = \\{a_i, a_j\\} = 0$ and $\\{a_i, a_j^\\dagger\\} = \\delta_{ij}$. Any weighted sums of products of these operators are represented with the FermionOperator data structure in OpenFermion. The following are examples of valid FermionOperators:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "& a_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "& 1.7 a^\\dagger_3 \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "&-1.7 \\, a^\\dagger_3 a_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "&(1 + 2i) \\, a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "&(1 + 2i) \\, a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 - 1.7 \\, a^\\dagger_3 a_1 \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The FermionOperator class is contained in $\\textrm{ops/_fermion_operator.py}$. In order to support fast addition of FermionOperator instances, the class is implemented as hash table (python dictionary). The keys of the dictionary encode the strings of ladder operators and values of the dictionary store the coefficients. The strings of ladder operators are encoded as a tuple of 2-tuples which we refer to as the \"terms tuple\". Each ladder operator is represented by a 2-tuple. The first element of the 2-tuple is an int indicating the tensor factor on which the ladder operator acts. The second element of the 2-tuple is Boole: 1 represents raising and 0 represents lowering. For instance, $a^\\dagger_8$ is represented in a 2-tuple as $(8, 1)$. Note that indices start at 0 and the identity operator is an empty list. Below we give some examples of operators and their terms tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "I & \\mapsto () \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "a_1 & \\mapsto ((1, 0),) \\nonumber \\\\\n",

    "a^\\dagger_3 a_1 & \\mapsto ((3, 1), (1, 0)) \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "a^\\dagger_4 a^\\dagger_3 a_9 a_1 & \\mapsto ((4, 1), (3, 1), (9, 0), (1, 0)) \\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when initializing a single ladder operator one should be careful to add the comma after the inner pair. This is because in python ((1, 2)) = (1, 2) whereas ((1, 2),) = ((1, 2),). The \"terms tuple\" is usually convenient when one wishes to initialize a term as part of a coded routine. However, the terms tuple is not particularly intuitive. Accordingly, OpenFermion also supports another user-friendly, string notation below. This representation is rendered when calling \"print\" on a FermionOperator.\n",

FermionOperators also support a wide range of builtins including, str(), repr(), ==, !=, *=, *, /, /=, +, +=, -, -=, - and **.

As the name suggests, QubitOperator is used to store qubit operators in almost exactly the same way that FermionOperator is used to store fermion operators. For instance $X_0 Z_3 Y_4$ is a QubitOperator. The internal representation of this as a terms tuple would be $((0, \\textrm{\"X\"}), (3, \\textrm{\"Z\"}), (4, \\textrm{\"Y\"}))$. Note that one important difference between QubitOperator and FermionOperator is that the terms in QubitOperator are always sorted in order of tensor factor.

To obtain these Hamiltonians one must choose to study the system without a spin degree of freedom (spinless), one must the specify dimension in which the calculation is performed (n_dimensions, usually 3), one must specify how many plane waves are in each dimension (grid_length) and one must specify the length scale of the plane wave harmonics in each dimension (length_scale) and also the locations and charges of the nuclei. One can generate these models with plane_wave_hamiltonian() found in openfermion.hamiltonians.

    "## Basics of MolecularData class\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from electronic structure calculations can be saved in an OpenFermion data structure called MolecularData, which makes it easy to access within our library. Often, one would like to analyze a chemical series or look at many different Hamiltonians and sometimes the electronic structure calculations are either expensive to compute or difficult to converge (e.g. one needs to mess around with different types of SCF routines to make things converge). Accordingly, we anticipate that users will want some way to automatically database the results of their electronic structure calculations so that important data (such as the SCF integrals) can be looked up on-the-fly if the user has computed them in the past. OpenFermion supports a data provenance strategy which saves key results of the electronic structure calculation (including pointers to files containing large amounts of data, such as the molecular integrals) in an HDF5 container.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MolecularData class stores information about molecules. One initializes a MolecularData object by specifying parameters of a molecule such as its geometry, basis, multiplicity, charge and an optional string describing it. One can also initialize MolecularData simply by providing a string giving a filename where a previous MolecularData object was saved in an HDF5 container. One can save a MolecularData instance by calling the class's .save() method. This automatically saves the instance in a data folder specified during OpenFermion installation. The name of the file is generated automatically from the instance attributes and optionally provided description. Alternatively, a filename can also be provided as an optional input if one wishes to manually name the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When electronic structure calculations are run, the data files for the molecule can be automatically updated. If one wishes to later use that data they either initialize MolecularData with the instance filename or initialize the instance and then later call the .load() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basis functions are provided to initialization using a string such as \"6-31g\". Geometries can be specified using a simple txt input file (see geometry_from_file function in molecular_data.py) or can be passed using a simple python list format demonstrated below. Atoms are specified using a string for their atomic symbol. Distances should be provided in angstrom. Below we initialize a simple instance of MolecularData without performing any electronic structure calculations."

    "Fermion Hamiltonians can be expressed as $H = h_0 + \\sum_{pq} h_{pq}\\, a^\\dagger_p a_q + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs} \\, a^\\dagger_p a^\\dagger_q a_r a_s$ where $h_0$ is a constant shift due to the nuclear repulsion and $h_{pq}$ and $h_{pqrs}$ are the famous molecular integrals. Since fermions interact pairwise, their energy is thus a unique function of the one-particle and two-particle reduced density matrices which are expressed in second quantization as $\\rho_{pq} = \\left \\langle p \\mid a^\\dagger_p a_q \\mid q \\right \\rangle$ and $\\rho_{pqrs} = \\left \\langle pq \\mid a^\\dagger_p a^\\dagger_q a_r a_s \\mid rs \\right \\rangle$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the RDMs and molecular Hamiltonians are both compactly represented and manipulated as 2- and 4- index tensors, we can represent them in a particularly efficient form using  similar data structures. The InteractionOperator data structure can be initialized for a Hamiltonian by passing the constant $h_0$ (or 0), as well as numpy arrays representing $h_{pq}$ (or $\\rho_{pq}$) and $h_{pqrs}$ (or $\\rho_{pqrs}$). Importantly, InteractionOperators can also be obtained by calling MolecularData.get_molecular_hamiltonian() or by calling the function get_interaction_operator() (found in openfermion.transforms) on a FermionOperator. The InteractionRDM data structure is similar but represents RDMs. For instance, one can get a molecular RDM by calling MolecularData.get_molecular_rdm(). When generating Hamiltonians from the MolecularData class, one can choose to restrict the system to an active space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes inherit from the same base class, PolynomialTensor. This data structure overloads the slice operator [] so that one can get or set the key attributes of the InteractionOperator: $\\textrm{.constant}$, $\\textrm{.one_body_coefficients}$ and $\\textrm{.two_body_coefficients}$ . For instance, InteractionOperator[(p, 1), (q, 1), (r, 0), (s, 0)] would return $h_{pqrs}$ and InteractionRDM would return $\\rho_{pqrs}$. Importantly, the class supports fast basis transformations using the method PolynomialTensor.rotate_basis(rotation_matrix).\n",
    "But perhaps most importantly, one can map the InteractionOperator to any of the other data structures we've described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we load MolecularData from a saved calculation of LiH. We then obtain an InteractionOperator representation of this system in an active space. We then map that operator to qubits. We then demonstrate that one can rotate the orbital basis of the InteractionOperator using random angles to obtain a totally different operator that is still iso-spectral."
