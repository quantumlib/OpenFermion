        "Fermionic systems are often treated in second quantization where arbitrary operators can be expressed using the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, $a^\\dagger_k$ and $a_k$.  The fermionic ladder operators play a similar role to their qubit ladder operator counterparts, $\\sigma^+_k$ and $\\sigma^-_k$ but are distinguished by the canonical fermionic anticommutation relations, $\\{a^\\dagger_i, a^\\dagger_j\\} = \\{a_i, a_j\\} = 0$ and $\\{a_i, a_j^\\dagger\\} = \\delta_{ij}$. Any weighted sums of products of these operators are represented with the FermionOperator data structure in OpenFermion. The following are examples of valid FermionOperators:\n",

In order to support fast addition of FermionOperator instances, the class is implemented as hash table (python dictionary). The keys of the dictionary encode the strings of ladder operators and values of the dictionary store the coefficients. The strings of ladder operators are encoded as a tuple of 2-tuples which we refer to as the \"terms tuple\". Each ladder operator is represented by a 2-tuple. The first element of the 2-tuple is an int indicating the tensor factor on which the ladder operator acts. The second element of the 2-tuple is Boole: 1 represents raising and 0 represents lowering. For instance, $a^\\dagger_8$ is represented in a 2-tuple as $(8, 1)$. Note that indices start at 0 and the identity operator is an empty list.

There is code in both openfermion.transforms and openfermion.utils which facilitates this. The function get_sparse_operator converts either a FermionOperator, a QubitOperator or other more advanced classes such as InteractionOperator to a scipy.sparse.csc matrix. There are numerous functions in openfermion.utils which one can call on the sparse operators such as \"get_gap\", \"get_hartree_fock_state\", \"get_ground_state\", etc. We show this off by computing the ground state energy of the Hubbard model. To do that, we use code from the openfermion.hamiltonians module which constructs lattice models of fermions such as Hubbard models."

To obtain these Hamiltonians one must choose to study the system without a spin degree of freedom (spinless), one must the specify dimension in which the calculation is performed (n_dimensions, usually 3), one must specify how many plane waves are in each dimension (grid_length) and one must specify the length scale of the plane wave harmonics in each dimension (length_scale) and also the locations and charges of the nuclei. One can generate these models with plane_wave_hamiltonian() found in openfermion.hamiltonians. For simplicity, below we compute the Hamiltonian in the case of zero external charge (corresponding to the uniform electron gas, aka jellium).

Often, one would like to analyze a chemical series or look at many different Hamiltonians and sometimes the electronic structure calculations are either expensive to compute or difficult to converge (e.g. one needs to mess around with different types of SCF routines to make things converge). Accordingly, we anticipate that users will want some way to automatically database the results of their electronic structure calculations so that important data (such as the SCF integrals) can be looked up on-the-fly if the user has computed them in the past. OpenFermion supports a data provenance strategy which saves key results of the electronic structure calculation (including pointers to files containing large amounts of data, such as the molecular integrals) in an HDF5 container.\n",

One initializes a MolecularData object by specifying parameters of a molecule such as its geometry, basis, multiplicity, charge and an optional string describing it. One can also initialize MolecularData simply by providing a string giving a filename where a previous MolecularData object was saved in an HDF5 container. One can save a MolecularData instance by calling the class's .save() method. This automatically saves the instance in a data folder specified during OpenFermion installation. The name of the file is generated automatically from the instance attributes and optionally provided description. Alternatively, a filename can also be provided as an optional input if one wishes to manually name the file.\n",

        "Basis functions are provided to initialization using a string such as \"6-31g\". Geometries can be specified using a simple txt input file (see geometry_from_file function in molecular_data.py) or can be passed using a simple python list format demonstrated below. Atoms are specified using a string for their atomic symbol. Distances should be provided in angstrom.
