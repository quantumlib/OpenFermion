In order to support fast addition of FermionOperator instances, the class is implemented as hash table (python dictionary). The keys of the dictionary encode the strings of ladder operators and values of the dictionary store the coefficients. Each ladder operator is represented by a 2-tuple. The first element of the 2-tuple is an int indicating the tensor factor on which the ladder operator acts. The second element of the 2-tuple is Bool: 1 represents creation and 0 represents annihilation. \n",
