    "# Tutorial 1: Compiling arbitrary single-particle basis rotations in linear depth\n",
    "This is the first of several tutorial explaining key concepts in OpenFermion-Cirq. These tutorials build on one another and should be studied in order. In this tutorial we will discuss the compilation of circuits for implementing arbitrary rotations of the single-particle basis of an electronic structure simulation. As an example, we show how one can use these methods to simulate the evolution of an arbitrary non-interacting fermion model."

    "### Second quantized fermionic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent fermionic systems on a quantum computer one must first discretize space. Usually, one expands the many-body wavefunction in a basis of spin-orbitals $\\varphi_p = \\varphi_p(r)$ which are single-particle basis functions. For reasons of spatial efficiency, all NISQ (and even most error-corrected) algorithms for simulating fermionic systems focus on representing operators in second-quantization. Second-quantized operators are expressed using the fermionic creation and annihilation operators, $a^\\dagger_p$ and $a_p$. The action of $a^\\dagger_p$ is to excite a fermion in spin-orbital $\\varphi_p$ and the action of $a_p$ is to annihilate a fermion from spin-orbital $\\varphi_p$. Specifically, if electron $i$ is represented in a space of spin-orbitals $\\{\\varphi_p(r_i)\\}$ then $a^\\dagger_p$ and $a_p$ are related to Slater determinants through the equivalence,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle r_0 \\cdots r_{\\eta-1} | a^\\dagger_{0} \\cdots a^\\dagger_{\\eta-1} | \\varnothing\\rangle \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\eta!}}\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "\\varphi_{0}\\left(r_0\\right) & \\varphi_{1}\\left( r_0\\right) & \\cdots & \\varphi_{\\eta-1} \\left( r_0\\right) \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the number of electrons in the system, $|\\varnothing \\rangle$ is the Fermi vacuum and $\\varphi_p(r)=\\langle r|\\varphi_p \\rangle$ are the single-particle orbitals that define the basis. By using a basis of Slater determinants, we ensure antisymmetry in the encoded state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotations of the single-particle basis\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often in electronic structure calculations one would like to rotate the single-particle basis. That is, one would like to generate new orbitals that are formed from a linear combination of the old orbitals. Any particle-conserving rotation of the single-particle basis can be expressed as\n",

    "\\quad\n",

    "$$\n",
    "where $\\tilde{\\varphi}_p$, $\\tilde{a}^\\dagger_p$, and $\\tilde{a}^\\dagger_p$ correspond to spin-orbitals and operators in the rotated basis and $u$ is an $N\\times N$ unitary matrix. From the Thouless theorem, this single-particle rotation\n",
    "is equivalent to applying the $2^N \\times 2^N$ operator\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  U(u) = \\exp\\left(\\sum_{pq} \\left[\\log u \\right]_{pq} \\left(a^\\dagger_p a_q - a^\\dagger_q a_p\\right)\\right) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\left[\\log u\\right]_{pq}$ is the $(p, q)$ element of the matrix $\\log u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons that one might be interested in performing such basis rotations. For instance, one might be interested in preparing the Hartree-Fock (mean-field) state of a chemical system, by rotating from some initial orbitals (e.g. atomic orbitals or plane waves) into the molecular orbitals of the system. Alternatively, one might be interested in rotating from a basis where certain operators are diagonal (e.g. the kinetic operator is diagonal in the plane wave basis) to a basis where certain other operators are diagonal (e.g. the Coulomb operator is diagonal in the position basis). Thus, it is a very useful thing to be able to apply circuits corresponding to $U(u)$ on a quantum computer in low depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling linear depth circuits to rotate the orbital basis\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFermion-Cirq prominently features routines for implementing the linear depth / linear connectivity basis transformations described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 110501](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.110501). While we will not discuss this functionality here, we also support routines for compiling the more general form of these transformations which do not conserve particle-number, known as a Bogoliubov transfomation, using routines described in [Phys. Rev. Applied 9, 044036](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.9.044036). We will not discuss the details of how these methods are implemented here and instead refer readers to those papers. All that one needs in order to compile the circuit $U(u)$ using OpenFermion-Cirq is the $N \\times N$ matrix $u$, which we refer to in documentation as the \"basis_transformation_matrix\". Note that if one intends to apply this matrix to a computational basis state with only $\\eta$ electrons, then one can reduce the number of gates required by instead supplying the $\\eta \\times N$ rectangular matrix that characterizes the rotation of the occupied orbitals only. OpenFermion-Cirq will automatically take advantage of this symmetry."

Of course, this is a tractable problem classically but we discuss it here since it is often useful as a subroutine for more complex quantum simulations. To accomplish this evolution, we will use basis transformations. Suppose that $u$ is the basis transformation matrix that diagonalizes $T$. Then, we could implement $e^{-i H t}$ by implementing $U(u)^\\dagger (\\prod_{k} e^{-i \\lambda_k Z_k}) U(u)$ where $\\lambda_k$ are the eigenvalues of $T$. \n",
