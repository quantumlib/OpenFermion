## Features

OpenFermion is an open-source Python package for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms to
simulate fermionic systems, including quantum chemistry. Among other features, it includes data
structures and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic and qubit
Hamiltonians. More information can be found in the [release
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07629).

## Installation

Installing the latest **stable** OpenFermion requires the Python package installer
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io). (Make sure that you are using an up-to-date version of it.)

Currently, OpenFermion is tested on Mac, Windows, and Linux. We recommend using Mac or Linux because
the electronic structure plugins are only compatible on these platforms. However, for those who
would like to use Windows, or for anyone having other difficulties with installing OpenFermion or
its plugins, we provide instructions for creating and using a Docker image – see the
[`docker/`](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/tree/main/docker) subdirectory. The Docker
image provides a virtual environment with OpenFermion and select plugins pre-installed. The Docker
installation should run on any operating system where Docker can be used.

### User installation

To install the latest PyPI release of OpenFermion as a Python package for the current user (which
avoids modifying system Python packages), run the following command:

```shell
python -m pip install --user openfermion
```

### Developer installation

To install the latest version of OpenFermion in development mode, run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion
cd OpenFermion
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Plugins

OpenFermion relies on modular plugin packages for significant functionality. Specifically, plugins
are used to simulate and compile quantum circuits and to perform classical electronic structure
calculations. Follow the links below to learn more!

### High-performance simulators

*   [OpenFermion-FQE](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-FQE) is a high-performance emulator
    of fermionic quantum evolutions specified by a sequence of fermion operators, which can exploit
    fermionic symmetries such as spin and particle number.

### Circuit compilation plugins

*   [Forest-OpenFermion](https://github.com/rigetticomputing/forestopenfermion) to support
    integration with [Forest](https://www.rigetti.com/forest).
*   [SFOpenBoson](https://github.com/XanaduAI/SFOpenBoson) to support integration with [Strawberry
    Fields](https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields).

### Electronic structure package plugins

*   [OpenFermion-Psi4](http://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-Psi4) to support integration with
    [Psi4](http://psicode.org).
*   [OpenFermion-PySCF](http://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF) to support integration with
    [PySCF](https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf).
*   [OpenFermion-Dirac](https://github.com/bsenjean/Openfermion-Dirac) to support integration with
    [DIRAC](http://diracprogram.org/doku.php).
*   [OpenFermion-QChem](https://github.com/qchemsoftware/OpenFermion-QChem) to support integration
    with [Q-Chem](https://www.q-chem.com).

## Documentation

Documentation for OpenFermion can be found at

## Contributing to OpenFermion

We'd love to accept your contributions and patches to OpenFermion. There are a few small guidelines
you need to follow.

*   Contributions to OpenFermion must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You
    (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; the CLA simply gives us permission
    to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the OpenFermion project. Please visit
    https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.
*   All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull
    requests for this purpose. Consult the appropriate [GitHub Help
    documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on
    using pull requests.
*   Please make sure your new code comes with extensive tests! We use automatic testing to make sure
    all pull requests pass tests and do not decrease overall test coverage by too much.
*   Please also make sure to follow the OpenFermion source code style. We mostly follow Python's
    [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines and use the corresponding
    [linter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) to check for it.
*   Code should always be accompanied by documentation. Formatted OpenFermion documentation is
    generated automatically and can be found [on the Quantum AI web
    site](https://quantumai.google/openfermion).
*   We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/issues) for tracking requests
    and bugs. Please post questions to the [Quantum Computing Stack
    Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/) with an `openfermion` tag.
